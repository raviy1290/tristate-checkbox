tristate-checkbox
=================

Tri-state Check-box (checked, unchecked, indeterminate) in HTML using JQuery (normal JavaScript could be supported)

In HTML only two states for check-box are supported (checked/ unchecked). But many times third state in needed (indeterminate) 
which is visually possible.

All these states can be passed to serverside with help of javascript(Ajax)
